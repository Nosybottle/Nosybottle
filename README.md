Hi, Iâ€™m @Nosybottle

I'm a self taught python programmer (first and only programming language I know), by which I mean I'm still slowly learning on my own. With an attention span of a crucified mayfly it goes rather slowly and not very well.

Besides learning python I'm also just discovering all the different buttons on GitHub. What they do I'll try to figure out at a later date.
